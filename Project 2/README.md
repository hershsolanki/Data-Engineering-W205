Welcome!

First, start by going to "Annotated Markdown.md". Here I have explained all the steps before getting into PySpark. From there, head on to "Pyspark Side" to see everything that was done in PySpark.

I did change the YML file to expose 8888 for me to run PySpark within the Jupyter notebook. I have added some figures within the Jupyter notebook in order to reflect some of the findings in a more interesting manner. 

Happy reading.
