Hello! 

Start by going through "Project 3 - Jupyter Notebook." There, I outline my step by step process in order to build the full data pipeline. When I run a file (such as Game API), I ask the reader to view that file. I have commented every file for ease of read.

My queries are at the bottom, in order to make sure my Stream Job has been completed correctly. I have omitted the Batch jobs, and only included the Streaming Job.


For the purpose of this project, I have worked with two types of data - Join and Guild and Purchase a Sword.
